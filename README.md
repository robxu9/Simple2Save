Simple2Save
===========

What is it?
-----------

A random pet-project that I decided to do after [alta](https://github.com/alta189) remarked to me that people were still using SimpleSave, months after we both deemed it needed a rewrite. (His annotation frenzy still irks me, though I do see some benefits there.)

I still use [SimpleSave](https://github.com/alta189/SimpleSave) for [my own project](https://github.com/MineQuest/MineQuest-API), because it still works... and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Plus, it's been quite reliable.

However, there is a need to improve some aspects of it. **Simple2Save** is **NOT** meant to be a continuation of [SimpleSave]; rather, a ground-up rewrite. I'll be backporting fixes to [SimpleSave] as I go along, and most likely somewhere in the middle, either that branch will end or this one as we attempt to merge works.

_(the api will never go away)_

_(I think)_

Why do this?
------------

Just for the hell of it. Plus, I need to work on my SQL skills again. I've gotten spoiled by ORMs... and I intend to fix that.
